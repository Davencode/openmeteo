# Open-Meteo API project 🌤️

This Project was developed only for personal purposes and to share some knowledge that I'm achieving during my experience in Flutter. 

Targets:
-
✅ 100% Implemented using Framework Flutter (Dart) 

✅ Retrieve data from the open-source API "Open-Meteo" for a specific location 


✅ For that location retrieving Forecast Data about next weather predictions about temperature 2m

✅ A little bit inspired from layouts about Dribble with simple and basic design

✅ Data converter to format Data in JSON to the correct format

✅ Icons change during the day

✅ Geolocalization to the current position through the floating button


Package used:

📝 _'package:intl/intl.dart'_ ---- Retrieving methods to DateFormat and change current data into a correct way

📝 _'package:http/http.dart'_ ---- Network call to make asynchronous call and fetch data into the open-meto API 

📝 _'package:flutter/material.dart'_ ---- Access to all material components about Dart.

📝 _'package:geolocator/geolocator.dart'_ ---- Access to all material components about Dart.
